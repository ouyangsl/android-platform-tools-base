    TODO: Before you run your application, you need a Google Maps API key.

    Follow the steps in the documentation.
    https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android/start

    A key looks something like "AIzaSyAhpLN7hAwBfFGjKcSe75MMjYWU7rvLwNw".

    Once you have your key, replace the "google_maps_key" string in this file.
