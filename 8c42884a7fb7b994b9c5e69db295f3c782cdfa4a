I\u0027m asking since I believe we use 0-based indices internally in the XML parser and elsewhere, and I thought I saw them passed through (and some errors initialized with 0, 0) so I was expecting either a +1 at the call site, or better yet use 0-based positions everywhere and simply convert to +1 at the display site, here.",
