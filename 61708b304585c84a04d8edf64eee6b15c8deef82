      "message": "That\u0027s weird. The old template clearly is using the package-relative syntax, yet it ends up with a full package name in the generated file.\n\nI suspect this is done by the manifest merger.\n\nWe should file an RFE for it to generate, or at least preserve, app package relative URLs.\n\nI think we should proceed with this CL since it\u0027s necessary in order for the activity references to work correctly (since activities can be inserted anywhere, not just in the app package). However, it would be great it we could also create a new variable, relativePackageName, generated by the infrastructure, which basically chops off the prefix of the ${packageName} if it starts with ${appPackage}. (I\u0027m assuming we also pass the appPackage in some variable to templates; it seems plausible that we\u0027d need it, for example to reference imports to the R class correctly.)",
