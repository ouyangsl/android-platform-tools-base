      "message": "I\u0027m a pretty big fan of using the File class to pass around paths (since it makes the API less ambiguous; in IntelliJ they have to make a distinction between system paths and system independent paths; some APIs use one, and some use the other, and we\u0027ve had a number of Windows specific bugs about it.\n\nTake a look at go/files-howto for a bunch of background on this.\n\n(This comment is mostly for the API; using Strings internally etc is totally fine. And obviously for *persistence* we\u0027d pick one, by convention /, and then convert to File.separatorChar when creating the File to return.)",
