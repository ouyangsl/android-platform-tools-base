These are files that are linked to //tools/vendor for bzlmod to load.

BUILD is always linked.
If vendor dependencies are loaded, then vendor.MODULE.bazel is linked to
//tools/vendor/vendor.MODULE.bazel.
If vendor dependencies are not loaded, then empty.MODULE.bazel is linked to
//tools/vendor/vendor.MODULE.bazel.
