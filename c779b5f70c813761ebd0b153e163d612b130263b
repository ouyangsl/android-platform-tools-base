      "message": "Hmmmm. To be pedantic, this isn\u0027t quite right; GB and GiB are slightly different. 1 GB \u003d 1000^3, 1 GiB \u003d 1024^3. Therefore, we could introduce new units instead, GB, MB and KB here, with base 1000^n instead.\n\nBut I do realize that these units are often treated as synonyms for the \"i\"-versions, so perhaps that\u0027s the intent here with these display names?",

      "message": "When I asked J about this, he pointed me at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_prefix which lists GB, KB, and MB as acceptable synonyms for GiB, MiB, and KiB. He also made the point that we don\u0027t use GiB when reporting real device specifications, even though that\u0027s what we mean. Feel free to discuss.",
