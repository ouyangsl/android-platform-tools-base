      "message": "I don\u0027t know if that\u0027s possible, but I would love to see TaskManager not have a reference to the plugin. This way we could break the dependency cycle where plugin calls methods on Variant/TaskManager that end up calling methods on the plugin. This is like having a field called \"this2\", it doesn\u0027t really split the original class.\n\nCan we change BaseTask to have a field for the logger and a field for the builder, but stop passing the plugin everywhere?",
