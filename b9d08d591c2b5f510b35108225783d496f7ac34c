Sadly we cannot submit it here, but I can work on moving this patch to our current studio-main branch and resolving some merge conflicts.\n\nTo do that, can you please change the \"author\" info for this commit to your gmail account? I can see you have accepted CLA with your gmail email, but not with your @kuaishou.com one (which is currently listed as author).",

If there is anything I need to do next, just let me know.\n\nCurrently we built our own AGP from modified source code to temporarily bypass this problem. We hope to upgrade to the official version as soon as the official version becomes available. If it is convenient, please also let me know the fix plan.",
