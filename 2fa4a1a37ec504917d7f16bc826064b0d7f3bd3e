For some reason I was assuming thread pool would be global but that doesn\u0027t seem correct. right now there is two thread pools per device which doesn\u0027t make sense.\n\nStupid question - whats the advantage of using newSingleThreadExecutor as opposed to just creating a Thread for each request, since as you point out we already have logic in place to restrict to one active fetch at a time?\n\nwhat do you think of trying to create a static/shared thread pool? Overkill?",
