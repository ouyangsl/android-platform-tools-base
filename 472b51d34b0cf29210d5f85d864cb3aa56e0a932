      "message": "Looks good to me, but just a thought that might clean up a bit the code is to use a Map here, Maps are supported by the reproxier so this, or a new method could be Map\u003cString, FilterData\u003e getFiltersMap(). This would avoid the current duplication of looping through this collection and asking for a filter type.  I don\u0027t know this code very well so don\u0027t know if it is the right suggestion.",
