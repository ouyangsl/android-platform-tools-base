      "message": "Permissions shouldn\u0027t need special checks for each API; as of 1.3 there\u0027s a general permission check (implemented inside SupportAnnotationDetector) which should be able to handle *all* permission requirements.\n\nThe way this works is that the API which requires the permission (sounds like it\u0027s the watch face service) should be annotated with @RequiresPermission(allOf\u003d{permission-name-1, permission-name-2} and then the rest should work automatically. The error will show up at the place in the code where your own service extends the class annotated with @RequiresPermission (and there will be a quickfix to add it etc). For more info on this see go/android-annotations/.",
