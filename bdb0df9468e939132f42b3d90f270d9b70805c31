In a real app, a library with a helper view would be a dependency of the :app project and PersonView would end up in app-debug-unaligned.apk. I imagine this makes PersonView visible in test code.\n\nWhy would someone have a test-only dependency on an android library?\n\nIt also seems to me we should reference these classes from androidTest sources to make sure it compiles fine.",
