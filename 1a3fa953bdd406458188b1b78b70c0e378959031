      "message": "Is this correct?? The technical specs page for the Nexus 7 just says 7\"; if it was 7.3 I would think they would say that since they are accurate on the other devices (e.g. for Nexus 10 it says 10.0055). I also searched around and saw some other sizes which point to 7\" rather than 7.27.\n\nI also found a couple of screen dimension physical sizes listing the screen size as 151mm * 94mm -- which, if my simple geometry is right (sqrt(151*151 + 94*94) / 2.54) works out to 7.03 inches.",
