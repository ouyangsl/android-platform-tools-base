      "message": "This fixes an unrelated problem: when I ran lint on a large set of projects (to look for false positives in the new lint check) the HTML Reports contained a lot of lint warnings that Gradle projects should be lint checked with Gradle -- even though I had explicitly turned off that warning. That\u0027s what this part fixes.",

      "message": "Another unrelated bug, also discovered when looking for false positives. In files with many warnings on the same line (such as a strings.xml file without newlines) the infrastructure would sometimes fail because it makes sure that warnings must not equal. Here we add in column checking to disambiguate them.",
