Is it necessary in order to get the tests to run at all?\n\nIf not, I assume it would be much better for developers to make sure that the tests are really checking the app that they will build and distribute (e.g. to catch a test failure or crash if the code is accessing a method that was removed by ProGuard because you were missing a keep rule etc).",
