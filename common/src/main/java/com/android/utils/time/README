This library exists because the official Kotlin standard library version of this
is marked EXPERIMENTAL and the implementation may change at any point. Because
of the size of our project and the fact that our compile-time Kotlin and our
run-time Kotlin may be different, we cannot use that library until it stabilizes.

This is intended as a drop-in replacement, with the idea being that once the
standard library version stabilizes, we can replace this with that library.

Note that while this library uses the opt-in annotation for ExperimentalTime, it
is only for the Duration class which is not experimental any more as of Kotlin 1.6.
