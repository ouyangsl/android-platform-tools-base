Is it just to handle the fact that you are allowed to have an extra dot for a ninepatch?)\n\nHave you tested what aapt does with a.b.c.d.xl ? (I know that at least for value files, it auto-converts :,. and - into _, so the corresponding resources is a_b_c_d.)",

How about \n\"must (1) be a valid Java identifier, (2) use only lower case characters and (3) not be a Java keyword\".\n\n(Btw, that regexp doesn\u0027t check for whether the token is a Java keyword such as \"new\" or \"enum\".
