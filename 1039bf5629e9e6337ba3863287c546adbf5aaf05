      "message": "The logic here (with successfulOps etc) is a straightforward copy of Guava\u0027s ByteStreams.copy, except using Input/Output streams rather than the InputSupplier indirection, and of course the main point of the copy: Inserting extra bytes into the output before closing the file.\n\nThe point of all of this is to have very little extra overhead for the copy: We don\u0027t need to first copy the file, and then open it again to append to it; we do it all in one shot.",
