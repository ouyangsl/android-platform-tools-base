      "message": "a little bit of context: you can set fullBackupContent as a boolean, but only because we were considering making it an opt-in feature so we built in the ability to have it either on or off by default.\nFor launch it is an opt-out feature, which means that setting fullBackupContent\u003d\"true\" doesn\u0027t make sense, and you can set allowBackup\u003d\"false\" to do the same as fullBackupContent\u003d\"false\"\n\n SO,\ntl;dr;\ncan we not refer to the fact that fullBackupContent is also a boolean? Instead phrase it as only an xml resource as that\u0027s how we expect it to be used:\n\n\"On sdk version 23 and up, your app data will be automatically backed up. and restored on app install.
