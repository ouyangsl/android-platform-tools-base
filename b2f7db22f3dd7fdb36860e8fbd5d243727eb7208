      "message": "Hi Raphael, \nHere\u0027s the scenario: Your build.gradle contains \"compileSdkVersion \u0027android-L\u0027\" but you don\u0027t have the L Preview SDK installed. For example, somebody might have sent you a project which tests the new L features, but you haven\u0027t updated your own SDK yet.\n\nWhen you Gradle sync, the build fails stating that it cannot find platform android-L. \n\nWe have a quickfix now which offers to automatically install missing platforms (and build tools and local Maven repositories) on a build failure, so you just click the \"Install Android L\" link in the build output, and it runs through a little mini-license-acceptance dialog and then installs the missing package.\n\nThis feature was developed to work for all the non-preview platforms (18, 19, ...) but when we tested it with L, it didn\u0027t work, and Alex traced it down to the code below.",
