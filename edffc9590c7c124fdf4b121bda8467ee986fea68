      "message": "The Log docs says that debug logs are compiled in but stripped at runtime, which means that they do incur some cost (e.g. APK size, and possibly string pool size though I\u0027m not sure about the latter). \n\nIt sounds like your project is stripping them out with proguard; that\u0027s good, but not in the default proguard rules ($SDK/tools/proguard/proguard-android.txt.) Perhaps we should change that?\n\nAt first I was thinking that people who strip out the logging calls programmatically should just disable this rule, but come to think of it, I think this should be one of those rules that are probably off by default but can be enabled, similar to the other minor performance rules. Yes, I\u0027ll disable this one by default.",

      "message": "I guess I\u0027m wondering why you believe that info/debug logs should be stripped at compile time on release builds. My read of the official guidelines, which may certainly be a misunderstanding, was that because info was always available, it was fine to use in release builds, albeit sparingly (if it\u0027s not a warning or error, it\u0027a probably not necessary). Debug is also fine as long as you get with isLoggable, so that it\u0027s filtered at runtime by default - it\u0027s a bit more expensive, but fine. For the really expensive and/or verbose logging, *that\u0027s* where it\u0027s important to strip it at compile time.\n\nThose are the guidelines we\u0027ve used, but I suppose I haven\u0027t seen an official source.\n\nIn any case, I\u0027ve certainly seen examples out there of people stripping Log.i out in proguard configs, and it\u0027s off by default and controllable individually, so no problem with me.",
