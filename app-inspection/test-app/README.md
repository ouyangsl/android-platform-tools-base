### App Inspectors Test App

This app can be used to manually test App Inspectors. It is not the same
as `//tools/base/app-inspection/tests/test-app` which is the app used
by tests.

This app should ideally implement all the features supported by App
Inspectors:

* Native SQLLite Database
* Room SQLLite Database
* Work Manager
* Network including:
  * Native Java
  * OKHttp2
  * OKHttp3
