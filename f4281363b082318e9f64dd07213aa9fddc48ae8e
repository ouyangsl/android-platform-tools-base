      "message": "This is unrelated to the case-insensitive fix. I noticed that all matched qualifiers get checked *twice*; first when they are matched in the above checkAndSet (which means it won\u0027t get into the if-body and increment the counter), and then a second time the next iteration through the while loop, which is unnecessary work (and could potentially allow us to match an invalid configuration like values-en-rES-rUS which would clobber the first region code with the second.) I added a new test to verify that this no longer returns a valid folder configuration (it used to).",
