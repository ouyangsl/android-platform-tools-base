      "message": "From looking at the code and running this through in the debugger for different cases, I can\u0027t figure out why you would need to have both the path and the url. It seems to me like a url should always be sufficient.\n\nThis just worries me, since it seems like other people might have the same problem you did, where getResourcePath returns something that isn\u0027t necessarily useful. Having a single absolute descriptor seems better.",
